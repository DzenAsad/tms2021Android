When using #SPICE it is possible to redirect USB devices from the client to the virtual machine without needing to specify them in the QEMU command. It is possible to configure the number of USB slots available for redirected devices (the number of slots will determine the maximum number of devices which can be redirected simultaneously). The main advantages of using SPICE for redirection compared to the previously-mentioned -usbdevice method is the possibility of hot-swapping USB devices after the virtual machine has started, without needing to halt it in order to remove USB devices from the redirection or adding new ones. This method of USB redirection also allows us to redirect USB devices over the network, from the client to the server. In summary, it is the most flexible method of using USB devices in a QEMU virtual machine.
